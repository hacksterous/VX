## VX
#### VX: a command-line-style arbitrary-precision calculator and Verilog expression evaluator

VX is a calculator using the PyQt5 toolkit using a [LibBF backend](https://bellard.org/libbf/). It supports Verilog-like expressions (not the full Verilog standard), arbitrary precision arithmetic, complex numbers, modular inversion and exponentiation and common mathematical functions.

VX is in pre-alpha stage with lot of bugs.
