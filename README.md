## VX
#### VX: a command-line-style arbitrary-precision calculator and Verilog expression evaluator

VX is a calculator using the PyQt5 toolkit using a [LibBF backend](https://bellard.org/libbf/). It supports Verilog-like expressions (not the full Verilog standard), arbitrary precision arithmetic, complex numbers, modular inversion and exponentiation and common mathematical functions.

VX is in pre-alpha stage with lot of bugs.

VX was developed on GNU/Linux on an amd64 machine. A shared library for BF is included (pybf.so) for use with Python3.

#### How to Use

###### Install PyQt5
`#> sudo pip3 install pyqt5`

###### Install PyQt5
`#> cd VX; python3 VX.py`
